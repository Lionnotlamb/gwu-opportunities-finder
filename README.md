# 🎓 GW Opportunity Finder

An open-source platform that helps George Washington University students discover and share opportunities (like fellowships, grants, internships, and awards) in one searchable, filterable dashboard.

## 💡 Purpose
Many GW students miss opportunities because information is scattered across different offices and websites.  
This tool centralizes them in a single open, community-updated repository.

## 🚀 Features
- Search and filter opportunities by major, eligibility, or category.
- Easy to update via GitHub pull requests.
- Fully reproducible and open-source. Anyone can fork and improve it!
